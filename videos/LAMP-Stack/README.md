## LAMP Deployment
In the video below you see a demonstration of the deployment process for the LAMP cluster configuration. While the LAMP cluster configuration was modeled with the MoDMaCAO framework, the deployment process is visualized and recorded from the [SmartWYRM](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/rwm/smartwyrm) framework. In a nutshell, SmartWYRM utilizes the benefits of [OCCI-Studio](https://github.com/occiware/OCCI-Studio), the [OCCIWare Runtime](https://github.com/occiware/MartServer) environment and [MoDMaCAO](https://github.com/occiware/MoDMaCAO) to deploy and adapt cloud applications with OCCI.

### OCCI Model
The OCCI configuration to be deployed consists of 5 virtual machines hosting, 1 apache server, 3 tomcats, and 1 mysql component.
In the video below the described OCCI configuration is provisioned and deployed. Moreover, the deployed application is shortly demonstrated.
Please note that the provisioning and deployment times are speeded up:
