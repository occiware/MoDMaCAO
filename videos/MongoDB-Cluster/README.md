## LAMP Deployment
In the video below you see a demonstration of the deployment process for the MongoDB cluster configuration.
While the LAMP cluster configuration was modeled with the MoDMaCAO framework, the deployment process is visualized and recorded from the [SmartWYRM](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/rwm/smartwyrm) framework. In a nutshell, SmartWYRM utilizes the benefits of [OCCI-Studio](https://github.com/occiware/OCCI-Studio), the [OCCIWare Runtime](https://github.com/occiware/MartServer) environment and [MoDMaCAO](https://github.com/occiware/MoDMaCAO) to deploy and adapt cloud applications with OCCI.

### OCCI Model
The OCCI configuration to be deployed consists of 5 virtual machines hosting, 1 configserver, 1 router, and 3 shards. 
In the video below the described OCCI configuration is provisioned and deployed. Moreover, the deployed application is shortly demonstrated.
Please note that the provisioning and deployment times are speeded up:
